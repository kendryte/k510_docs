# 1 K510 System Memory Planning

The memory plan of the K510 is shown in the following figure:

![](../zh/images/system_memory_map/k510-system-memory-map.png)

There is a 512MB DDR on the K510 crb reference board, with a total of four areas planned:

- 0~240M planning for Linux kernel
- 240M~496MB is planned for share memory, using the method of reserving the CMA memory pool, so that the Linux kernel memory management subsystem can also allocate memory from the CMA pool in the absence of use of Share memory
- 496M~510M is planned for DSP use
- 510M~512M is planned for logo use

# 2 Device tree description

The memory planning of the K510 is described in a reserved-meory manner, through the reserved-memory nodes of the device tree. The relevant device tree node information is as follows:

```text
ddr_memory: memory@0 {
    status              = "okay";
    device_type         = "memory";
    reg                 = <0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x20000000>;
};

sharem_cma:sharem_cma@8000000 {
    compatible          = "k510-share-memory-cma";
    reg                 = <0x0 0xf000000 0x0 0x10000000>;  /*240M~496M*/
};

reserved-memory {
    #address-cells = <2>;
    #size-cells = <2>;
    ranges;

    cma_buffer: buffer@f000000 {
        compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
        reusable;
        linux,cma-default;
        reg = <0x0 0xf000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
    };

    dsp_buffer: buffer@1f000000 {
        no-map;
        reg = <0x0 0x1f000000 0x0 0xe00000>;
    };

    logo_buffer: buffer@1fe00000 {
        no-map;
        reg = <0x0 0x1fe00000 0x0 0x200000>;
    };
};
```

# 3 Buildroot related configuration

The system memory plan is all described in dts of the Linux kernel, but the loading address of the dsp firmware needs to be configured in buildroot:

configs/k510_crb_lp3_v0_1_defconfig：

configs/k510_crb_lp3_v1_2_defconfig：

BR2_TARGET_EVB_FIRMWARE_LOAD_ADD=0x1f000000
