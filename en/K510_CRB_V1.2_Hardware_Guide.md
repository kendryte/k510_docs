# 4 Introduction to each section of the development board

## 4.1 Input power supply

&emsp; &emsp; K510 CRB uses external 5V power supply, on-board two USB type C interfaces, can be used to power the development board, of which the UART interface is used to connect to the computer, the COMPUTER's USB interface can only provide 500mA current, in the case of insufficient power supply, please use the adapter at the same time to supply power at DC: 5V. The interface is shown in the following figure.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../zh/images/hw_crb_v1_2/image-hw_3_2.png" width=60%>
</div>

<center> Figure 4-1 Power input connector </center>

**Note: Limit the use of 5V power supply, when using the fast charge adapter, try not to connect other devices such as mobile phones at the same time, so as not to cause the fast charge adapter to incorrectly output a power supply higher than 5V, resulting in damage to the power supply part of the development board.**
&emsp; &emsp; Use the K2 toggle switch for power-up and power-down operation, as shown in the following figure.

## 4.5 Boot Mode and Reset

&emsp; &emsp; The K510 CRB has a variety of storage devices on board, and the boot mode is selected by configuring the levels of the boot pins, BOOT0 and BOOT1, with 0 and 1 representing low and high levels.

&emsp; &emsp; On the PCB, the startup mode is selected by the DIP switch shown in the following figure, and the core module has been designed to pull up BOOT0 and BOOT1, and the side of the on-dialing light marking ON represents the corresponding bit pull down effective, and the other side of ON corresponds to OFF represents the pull-up effective.

&emsp; &emsp; The K510 determines the chip boot mode by the status of the boot0 and BOOT1 hardware pins, and the boot mode selection is shown in the following table.

<center>Table 4-1 Boot modes</center>

| BOOT1   | BOOT0   | Startup mode      |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 0(ON)   | 0(ON)   | Serial port boot      |
| 0(ON)   | 1(OFF)  | The SD card boots      |
| 1(OFF)  | 0(ON)   | NANDFLASH boots |
| 1(OFF)  | 1(OFF)  | EMMC boots      |

## 4.14 Extending the Interface

&emsp; &emsp; In order to facilitate the implementation of custom expansion functions for users, a 30P 2.54mm expansion pin is reserved on the K510 CRB, which leads to a power supply and part of the GPIO, which the user can operate through the software iomux to map hardware resources such as I2C, UART, SPI to the corresponding GPIO to achieve external connection and expansion of the corresponding functions. The on-board interface is shown in the following figure. The detailed definitions are shown in the following table.

# 5 Introduction to the IMX219 Dual Channel RGB Camera Module

The IMX219 dual channel RGB camera module uses the Video IN interface in Section 4.12 to connect the K510 CRB V1.2 development board. Each camera inputs images to the K510 chip through the 2 lane MIPI CSI. Refer to IMX219 Dual Channel RGB Camera Module CAD.pdf for module structure size and interface, IMX219 PLCC28 datasheet rev1.0.pdf for IMX219 sensor related parameters, and JM-5546-120-Model.pdf for lens related parameters.

## 7.1 Installing the Driver

&emsp; &emsp; The K510 CRB has ch340E onboard to implement the USB-UART communication function, so the corresponding driver needs to be installed before use.

&emsp; &emsp; Use the driver in the package or download and install it at the following address.

&emsp;&emsp;<http://www.wch.cn/product/CH340.html>

## 7.2 Firmware burn

&emsp; &emsp; Please refer to[the K510_SDK_Build_and_Burn_Guide](./K510_SDK_Build_and_Burn_Guide.md)documentation.

## 7.3 Switch on and off

&emsp; &emsp; 1) Install the power cable and USB debugging cable.

&emsp; &emsp; 2) DIP switch selected to start from TF card.

&emsp; &emsp; 3) Power on the switch by toggling the switch as shown in Section 3.2.

## 7.4 Serial port debugging

&emsp; &emsp; After the driver is installed, power-on the K510 CRB, at which point the port appears in the PC's Device Manager - Port.

&emsp; &emsp; Using the serial port debugging tool, open the port number of the device, baud rate 115200.

&emsp; &emsp; As shown in the following figure, the device is "COM6", which is shown in the PC Device Manager.
